# Crime Prediction and Investigation System

## Project Overview  
This project aims to enhance public safety and law enforcement capabilities through two key objectives:  

1. **Crime Prediction**: A deep learning-based model to forecast future crime rates using historical crime data and demographic factors.  
2. **AI Detective System**: An AI-powered tool leveraging natural language processing (NLP) for case classification, urgency detection, and investigation planning.  

By combining advanced machine learning and NLP techniques, this system provides actionable insights and automates investigative tasks, improving decision-making for crime prevention and resolution.  

## Key Features  

### **Crime Prediction Framework**  
- Predicts future crime rates using deep learning models.  
- Visualizes predicted vs. actual crime trends for interpretability.  
- Evaluates performance using metrics like RÂ² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).  

### **AI Detective System**  
- **Case Classification**: Categorizes cases (e.g., cybercrime, financial crime) using a zero-shot classification model.  
- **Urgency Detection**: Assesses case priority based on sentiment analysis.  
- **Investigation Planning**: Generates actionable steps for investigators using GPT-2-based text generation.  
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Gradio for user-friendly interaction and visualization.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:  
  - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for deep learning.  
  - [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) for pre-trained NLP models.  
  - [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) for building interactive interfaces.  
  - [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) for graph-based visualizations.  
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for data visualization.
